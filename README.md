# Problem Overview
Welcome to the Nexus Bank Problem Overview! In our pursuit of acquiring deposits, Nexus Bank has conducted various campaigns. However, during our recent board meeting, the directors expressed dissatisfaction with our current situation and emphasized the need to optimize our operations.

To address this challenge, the Director of Nexus Bank has reached out to me, a Data Scientist, as they believe in harnessing the power of data to gain valuable insights and enhance our efficiency. My primary objective is to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, specifically examining how demographic factors like age and education influence customers' attitudes towards defaulting. 

# Aim
We aim to anticipate future customer behavior and assess the likelihood of deposits from our customers.

In addition, we strive to evaluate the effectiveness of our campaigns and develop targeted marketing strategies to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing customer behaviors, loan trends, and the impact of our marketing campaigns, Nexus Bank aims to optimize operations, mitigate risks associated with loan defaults, and improve customer deposits.

Join me in this endeavor as I delve into the power of data analysis to drive enhancements at Nexus Bank. Together, we can make informed decisions that will improve our campaigns, minimize risks, and enhance customer satisfaction.
